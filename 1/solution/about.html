      <p>I have some basic programming skills. I learned matlab during ITGK, but I have mostly used python since then. </p>
      <p>I have done a bit of programming in my physics class, where I have made simulations of various physical systems. However, I have no experience in HTML. </p>
      <p>By participating in this course i hope to get some understanding of HTML and to be able to create simple webpages. </p>
