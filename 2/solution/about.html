      <p>I have some basic programming skills. I learned matlab during ITGK, but I have mostly used python since then. </p>
      <p>I have done a bit of programming in my physics class, where I have made simulations of various physical systems. However, I have no experience in HTML. </p>
      <p>By participating in this course i hope to get some understanding of HTML and to be able to create simple webpages. </p>

        <h2>Questions Assignment 2</h2>
      </header>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style
            elements and external stylesheets?</strong><br />
          The last style defined is applied. Since the .css stylesheet is loaded
          at the beginning of the html file, all styles defined later in the
          file will overwrite the .css file.</li>
        <li><strong>Give a brief example of when to use ID (#id) and when to use
            classes (.class) in CSS.</strong><br />
          ID is used to select one unique element in the HTML file. The classes
          selects elements that are part of a perticular class. </li>

        <li><strong>What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?</strong><br />
          RGBA colors are the normal RGB colors but also specify opacity.</li>

        <li><strong>Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not
            inside the body element?</strong><br />
          See question 1, and css files are not part of the content of the
          webpage.</li>

            article element in the following HTML?</strong><br />
