Questions Assignment 6, IT2805, Erik Liodden

1. 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 because floatingpoint presision makes it impossible to
   store the number 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 exactly. 
2. The 'method' attribute defines how the form are submitted to the webserver.
   Post method will send the form as a separeate package, while the Get method
   will submit the form as part of the url.
3. See Question 2. One of the advantages of GET is that the completed form can
   be saved and reused later (eg. a Google search.). However, Get should not be
   used for forms containing sensitive data, like passwords etc.
4. HTML5/JavaScript are client side validation. Never trust the user. Client
   side validation can be bypassed by the user before the form is submitted to
   the server.
5. If the input on that particular field is expected to be sufficentily long,
   like a contact form or a facebook-post.
